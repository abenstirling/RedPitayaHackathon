## Getting Started

We have split up our project into the different parts of the flow diagram, which are split by langugage. Folder names are as follows:

- Verilog - Contains the code for the FPGA
- C - Contains the code that allows for python to communicate with the FPGA
- GUI - Contains the code that allows for the user to interact with the FPGA
- Python - Contains the algorithms for Morse Code encoding and deocding
